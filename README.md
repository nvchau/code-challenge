# Code Challenge Solutions

## Problem 1: Sum to N
Three implementations to calculate sum from 1 to n:
- **Loop**: Iterative approach
- **Gauss Formula**: `n * (n + 1) / 2` - O(1) time complexity
- **Recursion**: Recursive approach

## Problem 2: Currency Swap Form
Modern React/TypeScript form for swapping cryptocurrencies:
- Real-time price fetching and exchange rate calculation
- Bidirectional amount conversion
- Token search and validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS/SCSS
- Unit tests with Vitest

## Problem 3: Messy React Refactoring
Fixed critical bugs and performance issues in React component:
- **Bugs**: Logic errors in filter/sort, undefined variables
- **Performance**: Fixed useMemo dependencies, removed redundant computations
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript types, React keys, number formatting
